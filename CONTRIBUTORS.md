Contribution is more than welcome!

If you already know what you're doing then your first port of call is the Git issues.

However if you're more of a beginner you can start with the Marionette MDN resource to learn how to control B2G and Gaia:

To get your tests running refer to the README.md in this repository.

You can find me and other Mozillians that can help out in #qa and #mozwebqa on the irc.mozilla.org network.
